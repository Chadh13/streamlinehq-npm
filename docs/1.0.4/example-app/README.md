# An example app for version 1.0.4

It's created with create-react-app and uses streamlinehq npm package. Please read the package's README for more information.

## How to run

1. Copy `streamlinehq_example.json` into a file `streamlinehq.json`. Fill a `secret` value inside with an npm token taken from your [Streamline developer page](https://app.streamlinehq.com/profile/developer). 
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Run it with `npm start`

You can also temporarily change `package.json` to use/link a local copy of `@streamlinehq/streamlinehq` if you want to experiment with it.
